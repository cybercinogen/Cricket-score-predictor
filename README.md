Introduction
Cricket score prediction is a challenging problem due to the dynamic nature of the game and the wide range of factors that influence the outcome. This project builds a machine learning model to predict the total score for ODI matches using historical data and match statistics.

Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language
Pandas, NumPy: Data manipulation and analysis
Scikit-learn, XGBoost: Machine learning libraries
Matplotlib, Seaborn: Data visualization
Google Colab: Cloud-based environment for code development and execution
Installation
To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/cybercinogen/cricket-score-predictor.git
cd cricket-score-predictor
pip install -r requirements.txt
Dataset
The data used for this project consists of historical One Day International (ODI) match data. The dataset includes:

Match details (teams, venue, toss details)
Player statistics
Historical scores
Ensure that the dataset is available in the data/ folder in the expected format.

Usage
Once the environment is set up, you can run the prediction model by executing the following command:

bash
Copy code
python score_predictor.py
You can also modify the parameters, explore the data, and visualize various insights using the provided Jupyter notebooks.

Model
The project uses various machine learning algorithms, including:

Linear Regression: As a baseline model
XGBoost: To enhance prediction accuracy
Random Forest: For comparison
The best performance was achieved using XGBoost after hyperparameter tuning and feature engineering.

Results
The final model achieved an accuracy of X% for score predictions. Below is a sample plot showing predicted vs actual scores:
